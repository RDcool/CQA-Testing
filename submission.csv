The y-axis of the first graph represents the average total backlog, while the y-axis of the second graph represents the average total backlog.

The two graphs show that the average total backlog for individual backlogs is higher than the average total backlog for the total backlog. This is because individual backlogs have a higher number of cases than the total backlog. Additionally, the average total backlog decreases over time for both individual backlogs and the total backlog.
