    "Рассмотрим 4 основных метода обучения VLM:\n",
    "1. Контрастное обучение. Для каждого экземпляра (изображения) даём одно правильное (положительное) описание и несколько неправильных (отрицательных). При обучении учим модель предсказывать похожие представления для положительных пар и различные представления для отрицательных пар. Примеры моделей: CLIP, SigLIP.\n",
    "2. Маскирование. Модели обучаются восстанавливать пропущенный кусок изображения по текстовому описанию (Masked Image Modeling) или восстанавливать пропущенный текст по изображению (Masked Languge Modeling). Примеры моделей: FLAVA, MaskVLM\n",
    "3. Генеративный подход. Модели обучаются на генерацию целого изображения или текстового описания к изображению. Данный подход позволяет обучить более качественные модели, но он очень затратен по вычислениям. Примеры моделей: CoCa, Chameleon\n",
    "4. Использование предобученых компонентов. При обучении используем уже предобученые кодировщик изображений и языковую модель. Оставляем их замороженными и обучаем только проекционный компонент. Примеры моделей: Frozen, Qwen, BLIP2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Представленные методы редко используются по отдельности. При обучении обычно их комбинируют."

The graph also shows that the pulses are transmitted at a constant frequency, which is the frequency of the original signal. This allows the receiver to identify the puls\n",
      "    Answer: The graph illustrates the principle of PPS modulation by showing how the robot's PPS is modulated in response to the different human body parts. In particular, the robot's PPS is attenuated at the hands (i.e. θ = −0.5 in Eq. 1), while it is positively modulated at the head (valence 1.0).

This is because the proposed method uses a small number of RRs to represent the data, which allows it to achieve a high level of accuracy.

This line shows that the MSE of the estimator cannot be lower than the CRB line, which is a measure of the minimum MSE that can be achieved by any estimator. The graph shows that the MSE of the estimator is lower than the CRB line, which indicates that the estimator is performing better than the theoretical bound.

      "Prediction: The main takeaway from the graph is that the proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of both the number of objects and the range quality. This is because the proposed method uses a more efficient algorithm for object detection, which allows it to process the video data more quickly. As a result, the proposed method is able to achieve a higher number of objects and a higher range quality than the other methods. This makes the proposed method a more effective tool for object detection in video surveillance. \n",
      "    Answer: The main takeaway from the graph is that as the number of objects increases, throughput decreases, and query response time increases for both range queries and kNN queries. This is because the space-filling curves used in Bx-trees can cause \"false hits\", which reduce query utility. On the contrary, TPR*-trees have more complicated update operations which make query more efficient at a sacrifice of throughput. Finally, SP indexes consistently outperform other indexes in all settings.\n",

This is because the BP algorithm is a greedy algorithm, and it is not able to explore the entire search space. As a result, it is not able to\n",
      "    Answer: The sharp points in the graph correspond to the change of achievability scheme for different values of INR. As INR increases, the achievable scheme changes from one that uses only the first two power levels to one that uses all four power levels. This change in achievability scheme results in a sharp increase in the gap between the achievable scheme and the outer-bounds.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph shows that the percentage of groups for which a timetable was found decreases as the group size increases. This is because larger groups are more likely to have a timetable, and therefore are more likely to be targeted by the attacker. The attacker is more likely to target larger groups because they are more likely to have a timetable, and therefore are more likely to be targeted by the attacker. This is because the attacker is more likely to target larger groups because they are more likely to have a timetable, and therefore are more likely to be targeted by the attacker.\n",
      "    Answer: The graph shows that as the group size increases, the percentage of groups for which a timetable was found decreases.

This is evident from the fact that the proposed method is able to achieve a higher throughput than the baseline method. This is especially true when the number of users is small, as the proposed method is able to achieve a higher throughput than the baseline method.

      "Prediction: This graph shows the RMS error in reconstruction (RMSER) as a function of time for the case of a single data point. This is an important result because it shows that the RMSER decreases as time increases. This is because the RMSER is a measure of the accuracy of the reconstruction, and the more time is spent on the reconstruction, the more accurate the reconstruction will be. This is why the RMSER decreases as time increases. The graph also shows that the RMSER decreases more rapidly for the case of a single data point than for the case of multiple data points\n",
      "    Answer: This graph is significant because it shows the performance of the MAP-MHE state estimator over time. The results show that the state estimator converges to the true concentration field as time progresses, and that the RMSE is lower for smaller values of the sensor noise variance. This information is important for designing and implementing the MAP-MHE state estimator in practice.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph is used to compare the performance of different methods for estimating the parameters of a linear regression model. The methods are compared in terms of their mean squared error (MSE) and their standard deviation. The MSE is a measure of the average squared difference between the estimated values and the true values, while the standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the estimated values. The graph shows that the model greedy method has the lowest MSE and standard deviation, which means that it is the most accurate method for estimating the parameters of the linear regression model. The model greedy method is also the most efficient method\n",
      "    Answer: The graph is used to compare the probability density functions of node popularities pi from empirical data, the greedy model, and probabilistic model. The greedy model is a model of taxi trajectories that is generated by feeding random initial locations x and greedily sampling from the RNN.

About 40% pages in WM have a life time less than one day, due to the strong restrictions on WM page diffusions. However, as long as pages get through the first day, they are likely to stay alive for a longer time.

      "    Answer: The graph shows the distribution of initial range reciprocal for lane change maneuvers on highways and local roads. The mean initial range of lane change on the highways (75.8m) is longer than the initial range of lane change on local roads (60.2m). This suggests that human drivers are more cautious when changing lanes on local roads, where there is less space and more obstacles. Other percentile of range at initiation is also shown in TABLE VIII. An important observation is that if robot drivers are designed to be no more aggressive than the 90% lane change conducted by human drivers, then the shortest range at the initiation of lane changes is 17 meters on the highways and 22 meters for local roads. This suggests that robot drivers should be careful not to cut in too close to other vehicles, especially on local roads.\n",

      "Prediction: The posterior distribution is a probability distribution that is used to model the uncertainty in the data. In this case, the data is the location of the line, and the uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in the measurements. The graph shows that the posterior distribution is concentrated around the true location of the line, which is 750 mm.

      "Prediction: The graph shows that the distribution of tree heights in the Robinson Forest is skewed to the right, with a long tail of trees with heights above 20 meters. This is likely due to the fact that the forest is dominated by a single species, the eucalyptus, which is a large and long-lived tree. As a result, the forest is expected to have a long tail of trees that are not removed by natural processes. This is also supported by the fact that the forest is located in a region with a high level of human activity, which could contribute to the distribution of tree heights\n",

      "Prediction: The graph shows that the apparent resistance increases as the line resistance increases. This is because the line resistance increases the amount of current that is required to flow through the line. As the current increases, the apparent resistance also increases. This is because the line is now carrying more current, which makes it more difficult for the current to flow through the line. As a result, the apparent resistance increases. This is a common phenomenon in electrical engineering, and is often used to measure the performance of electrical systems.

Logistic loss is a continuous loss function that is defined as the negative log-likelihood of the true label.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph shows that the runtime increases as the sample size increases. This is because the larger the sample size, the more data there is to process, and the more time it takes to process this data. However, the Frobenius distance between two consecutive results decreases as the sample size increases. This is because the larger the sample size, the more accurate the results are likely to be, and the less time it takes to obtain these results. This suggests that there is a trade-off between accuracy and runtime, and that larger samples lead to more accurate results but also longer processing times. \n",
      "    Answer: The graph shows that the Frobenius distance (green curve) converges to zero already for small sample sizes (215 samples). This means that the accuracy of the results is not affected by the sample size. However, the runtime grows very fast (almost exponentially) with increasing sample size.

      "    Answer: The graph shows how the average duration of sentences generated by the FA-TA system changes when the bias value is varied. A positive bias value increases the transition probability, which leads to a faster generation of sentences.

The graph also shows that the distribution of all non-zero pairs with the shortest path distance is not uniform, which is also consistent with the results of previous studies. This suggests that there are some pairs that are more likely to have a short path distance than others. This could be due to the fact that some pairs are more connected than others,\n",

      "    Answer: The main message of the graph is that SNAP-it outperforms baselines in terms of sparsity and performance, even though it prunes before training. This is because pruning before training gives the network enough chance to adapt, which again indicates how these networks are overparametrised. Additionally, we find that `0-regularisation [48] performs notably poor.

About 40% pages in WM have a life time less than one day, due to the strong restrictions on WM page diffusions. However, as long as pages get through the first day, they are likely to stay alive for a longer time.

      "Prediction: The main takeaway from the graph is that the proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of both the mean and variance of the marginal likelihood. This is evident from the fact that the proposed method has the lowest mean and variance of the marginal likelihood in all three experiments. This suggests that the proposed method is able to better capture the uncertainty in the data and make more accurate predictions. The proposed method also has a lower mean and variance of the marginal likelihood, which indicates that it is more stable and less biased than the other methods. This is important for making accurate predictions and understanding the uncertainty in the data\n",
      "    Answer: The main takeaway from the graph is that the DRL approach is effective in solving the Van der Pol equation. This is evident from the fact that the results from the DRL approach agree well with those from the explicit Runge–Kutta (4, 5) method (the ODE45 method).\n",
      "Prediction: The graph shows that the deployment time increases as the number of nodes increases. This is because as the number of nodes increases, the system becomes more complex and it takes longer to deploy the system. Additionally, the graph shows that the deployment time is longer for the system with 100 nodes than for the system with 10 nodes. This is because the system with 100 nodes has more components and requires more time to deploy. In conclusion, the graph shows that the deployment time increases as the number of nodes increases, and that the deployment time is longer for the system with 100 nodes than for the system\n",
      "    Answer: The graph also shows that the deployment time is relatively small, even for a large number of nodes. This means that the blockchain deployment service is efficient and can be used to deploy blockchains quickly and easily.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph shows the distribution of network load for different values of H. The x-axis represents the load, and the y-axis represents the frequency of occurrence. The graph shows that the load values are concentrated around 0.2, with a few outliers at higher and lower values. This suggests that the network load is relatively balanced, with most users being active at moderate load levels. However, there is a small number of users who are either very active or very idle, which can have a significant impact on the overall network load. This information can be used to design policies to ensure that the network load is\n",
      "    Answer: The graph shows the throughput ratio as a function of the fraction of full-duplex clusters and the network load. The graph shows that the throughput ratio decreases as the fraction of full-duplex clusters increases and as the network load increases. This is consistent with the intuition that an increase in aggregate interference is more detrimental to the performance of an asynchronous system than to the performance of a synchronous system.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph shows that the model is able to accurately replicate the behavior of the mirror actuator. The test results show that the model is able to accurately replicate the behavior of the mirror actuator, with the values of the test data being very close to the values of the model. This suggests that the model is a good representation of the behavior of the mirror actuator. The test results also show that the model is able to handle the dynamic behavior of the mirror actuator. This is evident from the fact that the values of the test data are able to change over time, which is a key aspect of the dynamic behavior\n",
      "    Answer: The step response test results show that the actuator model is able to track the control signal with a small overshoot and a settling time of approximately 0.2 seconds. The model also shows a small amount of oscillation around the target value, which is likely due to the friction in the system. Overall, the results of the step response test indicate that the actuator model is well-behaved and capable of tracking the control signal accurately.\n",
      "Prediction: The main takeaway from the graph is that the proposed method is robust to the choice of the initial state. This is evident from the fact that the average AoI values of the proposed method are similar to those of the baseline method, even when the initial state is not well-distributed. This suggests that the proposed method is able to effectively recover the true AoI values, regardless of the initial state. This is a significant finding, as it shows that the proposed method is a viable alternative to the baseline method for estimating AoI. \n",
      "    Answer: The main takeaway from the graph is that the RBM-NQS-CS algorithm performs well for three-dimensional systems, even for systems of large size.

This is because FFR allows the base station to allocate more resources to the FFR users, which results in a higher coverage area. The graph also shows that the coverage gain increases as the number of FFR users increases. This is because the more FFR users there are, the more resources can be allocated to them, resulting in a higher coverage area.

This suggests that there is a limit to the amount of improvement that can be achieved by increasing the number of used top singular vectors.

      "Prediction: The graph shows that the regret decreases as time increases for both the SVM and Preference Perceptron algorithms. This is because the algorithms learn more about the data as time increases, and are able to make more accurate predictions. However, the SVM algorithm has a higher regret than the Preference Perceptron algorithm, which means that it is more likely to make incorrect predictions. This is because the SVM algorithm is more complex and requires more time to learn than the Preference Perceptron algorithm. The Preference Perceptron algorithm is a simpler algorithm that is able to learn the data more quickly and make accurate predictions.\n",
      "    Answer: The graph shows that the regret for both algorithms converges to a non-zero value as time increases. This is because the feedback is now based on noisy relevance labels, which means that the algorithms are not able to perfectly learn the user's preferences. However, the Preference Perceptron algorithm performs significantly better than the SVM algorithm, with a lower regret value. This is likely due to the fact that the perceptron algorithm is more robust to noise than the SVM algorithm.\n",

      "Prediction: The results shown in the graph suggest that the HS and ABC methods are more robust to the presence of noise than the STA method. This is because the HS and ABC methods are able to learn the underlying signal even when the noise is present, while the STA method is not able to do so. This makes the HS and ABC methods more reliable for estimating the underlying signal in noisy data. \n",
      "    Answer: The results shown in the graph indicate that STA is more capable of searching in depth than HS and ABC.

This is because a larger state space allows for more opportunities to learn and improve the policy. However, the performance also decreases as the number of states becomes too large, as it becomes more difficult to learn and improve the policy. The optimal value of m depends on the specific task and environment. In this case, the optimal value of m is around 1000 states. This is a relatively small number of states, which suggests that the task is not too complex and that the agent is able to learn and improve\n",

      "Prediction: The graph shows that the recoverable sparsity of objects for RI and MR is similar, but RI has a slightly higher sparsity. This is because RI uses a more sophisticated algorithm that takes into account the structure of the image, while MR uses a more simple algorithm that only considers the sparsity of the image. As a result, RI is able to recover objects with more detail than MR. However, both methods are able to recover objects with a high degree of sparsity, which is important for applications such as image compression and denoising. The graph also shows that the\n",
      "    Answer: The graph shows that the recoverable sparsity of objects for RI and MR increases quadratically as the number of sensors increases. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that the recoverable sparsity should scale as O(n2), where n is the number of sensors. The difference between recoveries with the exact and paraxial Green functions is negligible in both the RI and MR set-ups, indicating that the paraxial approximation is accurate for this application.\n",

This is because a larger step-size allows the algorithm to learn more about the system dynamics and make more informed decisions about pricing and resource allocation. However, the algorithm also becomes more sensitive to the choice of step-size, so it is important to choose a step-size that is appropriate for the specific problem being solved. In general, the algorithm converges in a few iterations for most values of step-size, but it can take several hundred iterations for some extreme values. This is because the algorithm is solving a nonlinear optimization\n",

The graph is generated by a computer, and it is based on the results of a simulation that was run to test the performance of the algorithm. The simulation was run with different values of the parameters, and the results were used to estimate the posterior distribution. The graph shows that the line is most likely to be in the center of the image, and that it is less likely to be in the corners. This information\n",
      "    Answer: The posterior distribution is a statistical measure of the uncertainty in the estimated value of a parameter. It is a probability distribution that represents the probability of the parameter taking on different values, given the observed data. In this case, the parameter is the line location, and the data is the spectrum of the galaxy. The posterior distribution shows the probability of the line being located at different wavelengths, given the observed spectrum.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph shows that the screen-in rate increases as the assessed risk score S increases. This is because a higher risk score indicates a higher likelihood of being infected with COVID-19, and therefore a higher screen-in rate is necessary to protect the health of the participants. The graph also shows that the screen-in rate increases more rapidly for higher risk scores than for lower risk scores. This is because a higher risk score indicates a higher likelihood of being infected with COVID-19, and therefore a higher screen-in rate is necessary to protect the health of the participants. The graph also shows that the\n",
      "    Answer: The graph shows that the screen-in rates are higher for higher risk scores and lower for lower risk scores. This is consistent with the goal of the system to screen in more high risk cases and screen out more low risk cases.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph shows that the distribution of tree heights in the Robinson Forest is skewed, with a long tail. This means that there are a few trees that are very tall, while the majority of trees are relatively short. This is likely due to the fact that the forest is dominated by a few very large trees, which are the result of a natural process. The rest of the trees in the forest are much shorter, and are the result of human activity. The skewness of the distribution can be seen in the graph, which shows that the number of trees with heights above 20 meters is much higher than the\n",
      "    Answer: The graph shows that the height distribution of trees in the Robinson Forest is bimodal, with two distinct peaks. The larger peak is associated with overstory trees, which have a mean height of 26.9 m and a standard deviation of 6.6 m. The smaller peak is associated with understory trees, which have a mean height of 9.4 m and a standard deviation of 2.6 m.\n",
      "Prediction: The results shown in the graph demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve good performance even when the number of training samples is limited. This is important because it means that the method can be used to train deep neural networks even when there is not enough data to train them well. The results also show that the proposed method is able to achieve good performance even when the number of training samples is very large. This is important because it means that the method can be used to train deep neural networks even when there is not enough data to train them well. The results also show that the proposed method is able to achieve good performance even when the number\n",
      "    Answer: The results shown in the graph demonstrate that the proposed neighbor discovery algorithm is robust to inter-train interference. Even with a small l/∆, the probability of successful neighbor discovery is high, and the average time needed to complete neighbor discovery is small. This is important for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the neighbor discovery process.\n",
      "Prediction: The room impulse response shown in Figure 8 is significant because it provides a visual representation of the sound field in the room. This information can be used to understand the acoustic properties of the room and to design strategies for sound control. For example, the impulse response can be used to determine the optimal position for a sound absorber in order to reduce reverberation. The impulse response can also be used to design filters for sound control. The impulse response is also useful for identifying the location of a sound source. In summary, the room impulse response is a powerful tool for understanding the acoustic\n",
      "    Answer: The room impulse response shown in Figure 8 is a typical example of a reverberant environment. It is characterized by a long decay time, which is a measure of how long the sound waves continue to echo after the original sound source has stopped. This decay time is related to the reverberation time Tr, which is a measure of how long it takes for the sound energy to decay by 60 dB. The longer the reverberation time, the more reverberant the environment.\n",
      "Prediction: The two graphs in Figure 2 show the processing time of the algorithm for different values of the number of leavers. The first graph shows the processing time for the algorithm with cache, while the second graph shows the processing time for the algorithm without cache. As can be seen from the graph, the processing time is significantly reduced when the algorithm is executed with a cache. This is because the cache allows the algorithm to access the data more quickly, which reduces the amount of time it takes to process the data. The graph also shows that the processing time increases as the number of leavers increases. This is because the algorithm has to\n",
      "    Answer: The two graphs in Figure 2 compare the computation cost of a ResNet community model with and without a caching mechanism. The left graph shows that the computation cost remains constant as the number of learners increases to 1000, while the right graph shows that the computation cost increases significantly without the caching mechanism.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph shows that the apparent resistance increases as the line resistance increases. This is because the line resistance increases the amount of current that is flowing through the line, which in turn increases the apparent resistance. The graph also shows that the apparent resistance increases more rapidly as the line resistance increases for higher values of R. This is because a higher line resistance results in a larger current flowing through the line, which in turn results in a higher apparent resistance. The graph also shows that the apparent resistance increases more rapidly as the line resistance increases for higher values of R. This is because a higher line resistance results in a larger current flowing through\n",
      "    Answer: The graph shows that the effect of line resistance is more pronounced for scenarios where the selected cell has a lower resistance. This is because the contribution of half-selected cells is less influential when the selected cell has a lower resistance. Reducing line resistance reduces the gap between the apparent resistance calculated for scenarios where the selected cell has a lower resistance and scenarios where the selected cell has a higher resistance.\n",
      "Prediction: The three loss functions shown in the graph are all non-linear loss functions. The 0-1 loss is a binary classification loss function, which is used to train binary classifiers. The Hinge loss is a hinge-shaped loss function, which is used to train binary classifiers with a hinge-shaped regularization term. The Logistic loss is a logistic regression loss function, which is used to train logistic regression models. The three loss functions have different properties and are used in different applications. For example, the 0-1 loss is used in binary classification, while the Hinge loss is\n",
      "    Answer: The three loss functions shown in the graph are 0-1 loss, Hinge loss, and Logistic loss. 0-1 loss is a binary classification loss function that is defined as the absolute difference between the predicted label and the true label. Hinge loss is also a binary classification loss function that is defined as the maximum of 0 and 1 minus the product of the predicted label and the true label. Logistic loss is a continuous loss function that is defined as the negative log-likelihood of the true label.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph shows that the runtime increases as the sample size increases, but the increase is not linear. This is because the runtime is affected by the number of samples, but also by the complexity of the model. In this case, the model complexity is measured by the number of parameters. As the number of parameters increases, the runtime increases more slowly. This is because a more complex model will require more time to train, but will also be more accurate. In this case, the model complexity is measured by the number of parameters. As the number of parameters increases, the runtime increases more slowly. This is because a more complex model will require\n",
      "    Answer: The graph shows that the Frobenius distance (green curve) converges to zero already for small sample sizes (215 samples). This means that the accuracy of the results is not affected by the sample size. However, the runtime grows very fast (almost exponentially) with increasing sample size. This shows that there is a trade-off between runtime and accuracy, and that a good trade-off would be any sample size between 500 and 2000 in this experiment.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph shows that the average ratio of sentence duration modification achieved by controlling the bias value in the FA-TA system is 0.96. This means that the FA-TA system is able to modify the duration of sentences in a way that is consistent with the context of the sentence. This is important for improving the readability of the text. The graph also shows that the average ratio is higher for longer sentences. This is because longer sentences contain more information, and therefore the FA-TA system is able to make more informed decisions about how to modify the duration of those sentences. Overall, the FA-TA\n",
      "    Answer: The graph shows how the average duration of sentences generated by the FA-TA system changes when the bias value is varied. A positive bias value increases the transition probability, which leads to a faster generation of sentences. A negative bias value decreases the transition probability, which leads to a slower generation of sentences. The graph shows that the average duration of sentences can be increased or decreased by more than 10% by controlling the bias value.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph is used to compare the performance of the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods. The x-axis represents the different methods, while the y-axis represents the average test error. The graph shows that the proposed method achieves the best performance, with a test error of 0.0012. The other methods have significantly higher test errors, with the worst method having a test error of 0.0112. This shows that the proposed method is the most effective method for image classification. \n",
      "    Answer: The graph is used to illustrate the different user statuses with varied types of observed activity logs. It shows that there are C = T/τ snapshots, and the ground-truth label of user activities during snapshot t − 1 is the attrition status within future snapshot t, 2 ≤ t ≤ C.\n",
      "Prediction: The graph shows that the distribution of all non-zero pairs with the shortest path distance is a power law. This means that the number of non-zero pairs with a short path distance decreases as the path distance increases. This is likely due to the fact that the network is more densely connected at shorter path distances. The graph also shows that the distribution is scale-free, which means that the number of non-zero pairs with a short path distance is not concentrated in a single cluster. Instead, the distribution is spread out across the network. This is consistent with the fact that the network is a scale-free network\n",
      "    Answer: The graph shows that the distribution of all non-zero pairs with the shortest path distance is skewed to the right. This means that there are more pairs with shorter shortest path distances than there are pairs with longer shortest path distances. The mean of the distribution is 38.87 meters, while the median is 36.5 meters and the mode is 27.5 meters. The maximum shortest path distance can reach up to 123.1 meters, with a standard deviation of 21.4 meters and an inter quartile range of 30.5 meters.\n",

В нашем случае нельзя одназначно сказать улучшили ли мы качество нашей модели (модель считает, что она стала хуже). Возможно дообучение на всём датасете, дообучение на [flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) или выбор более мощных моделей, таких как [ChartGemma](https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartGemma) или ChartPaLi(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12596v1) могут улучшить результат. Но для этого нужна более мощная видеокарта.\n",
    "\n",
    "Также улучшить качество могло использование так называемых гибридных VLM/LLM. Например, популярной связки [DePlot](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10505v2) + мощной LLM, в которой DePlot представляет информацию с графика в виде таблицы, а LLM на её основе даёт ответы.\n",
    "\n",
    "Дополнительно хотел отметить хорошую оптимизацию обучения с помощью библиотеки [PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index) и квантинизацию с помощью библиотеки [bitsandbytes](https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/index) от Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "Надеюсь, что для моего первого раза получилось неплохо. Буду рад получить фидбек."
